<h1><a href="https://tailwood.vercel.app/">Cool Tailwood CSS Project</a></h1>

* [See the Project](https://tailwood.vercel.app/)

* Summary:
  A UI component system is one of the cornerstones of modern web application development. Complex websites, software applications and SaaS platforms often have their own "design language", and a UI component system expresses that language in a standardized way.

    Tailwind is a low-level CSS library that lets you create your own UI components from scratch. It is a powerful building block rather than a full component library.

    In this challenge, I built, refined and explained my own design system!
