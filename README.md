<h2 id='fun'>About my Cool Tailwood</h2>


*  A UI component system is one of the cornerstones of modern web application development. Complex websites, software applications and SaaS platforms often have their own "design language", and a UI component system expresses that language in a standardized way.
* Tailwind is a low-level CSS library that lets you create your own UI components from scratch. It is a powerful building block rather than a full component library. In this challenge, I built, refined and explained my own design system!

<h1 id='planning-presentation'>Planning & Presentation Requirements</h1>
    A design language is the core of your UI component system. It has the following categories:

* Color

* Typography

* Spacing

* Imagery

For this prohect I designed these components: 
* Header

* Footer

* Anchor tag / Link styling

* Buttons (few different styles )

* Cards

* Plain text styling (a few different styles

* h1/h2/h3/h4/h5/h6 tag styling

* Image

* Ordered & unordered lists

* Sections with image

* Team
<h1>ALL THE ABOVE COMPONENTS ARE MODULAR SO YOU CAN PASS PROPS AND CHANGE THE HEADER OF THE COMPONENTS< PARAGRAPH OF THE COMPONENTS < IMAGES AND ALSO APPLY MORE CLASSES!</h1>

* Examples:
```Bash
      <Services
                hclass="mb-8 font-bold text-3xl mb-2 text-center text-cyan-med"
                pclass="font-medium text-xl mb-2  text-cyan-dark text-base"
                btnclass="bg-cyan-light hover:bg-cyan-dark text-falling-gray font-bold py-4 p-6 border border-falling-gray rounded my-8"
